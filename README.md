This is a poem project for my creative coding class. I created this after viewing the novel, Alice in Wonderland, on Project Gutenberg books. I really enjoyed making a novel after this text because the words that are used within the novel interest me.

"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll
